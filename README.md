  Immediate Inference PWA
</h1>
<p align="center">Get all true statements from your inputed statement using immediate inference in logic</p>

## 🙄 Why?
My main purpose of developing such an app was to extract all true statement rules from Quran & Hadith which I -as a Shia muslim- believe in their truthness. It's kind of like [what Mulla Sadra did to prove a Hadith using a Quran's Ayah based on the obverted contraposition.](https://maktabevahy.org/Document/Speech/Details/14/%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%AF-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%AA%D8%A7-%D8%AE%D8%AF%D8%A7-%D8%B1%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B3%DB%8C?page=5http)

You can enter your predicative or conditional statement in this app and then get all true statements based on what you've entered. These statements which are deduced by immediate inference are conversion, obverted contraposition, obvertion(for subject(or antecedent), predicate(or consequent) and both).

## 💁‍♂️Contrabution
This PWA has been developed using Gatsby. So you can feel free to install the packages:
```shell
npm install
```
and then run:
```shell
npm run develop
```
**Note:** Please be aware that fonts might not shown correctly. That's because of Github Pages; It was required to use a path prefix of "/immediate-inference" for the URL of the imported fonts which would result in 404 in local development, but fine in deployment.
